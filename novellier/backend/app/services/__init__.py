# This file makes Python treat the 'services' directory as a package.

# You can import modules from this package here if you want them to be
# easily accessible from the 'services' namespace.
# For example:
# from .ai_module import ethos, logos, pathos

# Or, you might have a factory function or specific services you want to expose:
# from .ai_module import init_ai_services

# For now, it can remain empty if all imports are handled directly
# where the services are used (e.g., in app/__init__.py or routes).
